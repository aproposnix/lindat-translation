<TU>	Each <TU> (Translation Unit) element contains zero, one or more <NOTE> elements, followed by zero, one or more <PROP> elements, followed by one or more <TUV> elements. The first <TUV> element in a <TU> is expected to be the source.
Logically, a translation-memory database is not complete unless there are at least two <TUV> elements in most Translation Units.
Each <TU> has several optional attributes: ID, O-ENCODING, DATATYPE, USAGECOUNT, LASTUSAGEDATE. CREATIONTOOL, CREATIONDATE, CREATIONID, CHANGEDATE, SEGTYPE, CHANGEID and SRCLANG.
<TUV>	Each <TUV> (Translation Unit Variant) specifies a text in a given language. It contains zero, one or more <NOTE> elements, followed by zero, one or more <PROP> elements, followed by one <SEG> element.
It has one mandatory attribute: LANG and several optional attributes: O-ENCODING, DATATYPE, USAGECOUNT, LASTUSAGEDATE, CREATIONTOOL, CREATIONDATE, CREATIONID, CHANGEDATE and CHANGEID.
<SEG>	Each <SEG> (Segment) contains the text of the <TUV>.
It has no attributes.
All spacing characters and line-breaks are significant inside a <SEG> element.



# Texts

Each TU is one translation unit. We can probably treat that as one sentence,
ie translate each TU independently.

In each TU, the first TUV contains one SEG which contains the text to be
translated.
The translation is to be filled into the SEG element of the second TUV (if
present; maybe it can be missing and has to be added).


# Languages

source language = LANG of first TUV of first TU (or SRCLANG from HEADER if set); but
as we are doing the translation sentence by senence, we can also simply
extract the LANG for each TU from its first TUV independenty (this is a
mandatory attribute)

target language = LANG of second TU in the TUV (LANG mandatory, but existence
of second TUV not mandatory; but in the sample it is always there)


# Other

Maybe we shpuld add some metadata from the translation system; e.g.
marking the source of the translation in each TUV:
            <PROP NAME="Origin">MT</PROP>
